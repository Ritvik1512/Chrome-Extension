# Chrome-Extension
This is still a work in progress. Tbh this doesn't work at the moment but surely will in the near future.
A really crude version is up there, but still icons need to be added and stability needs to be improved. This in no way is ready to be released for public use.

But in the future, the Chrome Extension will be the only plausible way for the user to use Phantom/PiedPiper. So this thing is definitely need to be cared about.
